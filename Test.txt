Dear Priyanshu,

I hope you are doing well.

I came across the opening for a Manual Tester position at your organization and would like to express my interest in applying.

I am a Detail-oriented Software Test Engineer with around 3 years of experience in Manual and Automation Testing. I have hands-on experience in Selenium WebDriver with Java, TestNG, Cucumber (BDD), Postman, Jenkins (CI/CD), and basic SQL for data validation. I am skilled in designing POM and Data-Driven Frameworks, performing Functional, Regression, UI, and API Testing, and have a solid understanding of SDLC, STLC, and Agile (Scrum) methodologies.

I have attached my updated resume for your review. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team’s requirements.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Abhay Kondalkar
9172016216
Pune kharadi.
